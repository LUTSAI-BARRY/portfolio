I am Jermann Barry Lutsai (“Lutsai the Tech Guy”), a SOC Analyst and cybersecurity professional preparing to launch my company, GuardZen. I want a modern, responsive personal portfolio website that reflects my tech-focus, professional brand, and mission.

What: A personal portfolio website — homepage + about section + skills/services + projects / lab work + blog/insights + contact + branding for “Lutsai the Tech Guy” + GuardZen company intro
Where: Online (hosted on my own domain) and accessible across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
When: Launch target Jan 2025 (in parallel to job hunting and GuardZen build)
Why: To present myself professionally, build credibility in the tech / cybersecurity space, and provide a platform for recruiting, job applications, client leads (for GuardZen), mentoring, and networking

Clean, professional, tech-savvy aesthetic (dark/light mode optionally, modern typography, clear visuals)

Hero/banner section with my name, tagline (“Lutsai the Tech Guy”), a strong image/logo, quick summary

About section: short one-line description (as you suggested), summary of background (diploma in Info Security & Ethical Hacking, academic diploma in Info & Cybersecurity), home lab setup, certifications (Security+, CySA+ in progress, EC-Council CSA…), job role goals (Tier 1 SOC Analyst)

Skills/Services section: bullet or icon-based list of SOC monitoring, SIEM (Splunk, Wazuh), threat hunting, pen-testing labs, mentoring young learners, GuardZen CaaS services

YouTube

Responsive design (mobile first)

Deploy live (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your own domain)

Optimised images, accessible markup, semantic HTML

Branding Notes:

Typography: modern sans-serif, clear headings

Visuals: maybe a photo of you working in your lab, cybersecurity themed icons, maybe abstract digital background

Call to Action:

“Hire me”, “View my projects”, “Contact me for mentoring & cyber services”

On the homepage hero section, include a button: “View portfolio” or “Get in touch”

Scope & Timeline:

Build initial MVP version by [set date] → maybe by end of December 2024 so you can start using during job applications in January 2025

Later phases: expand blog, GuardZen service pages, testimonials, case-studies

Deliverables:

Single-page or multi-section site (could be single page with scroll or separate pages)

Working navigation, responsive layout, all sections above

Please design the site so it can grow into GuardZen’s web presence later, but focus now on personal brand and portfolio.
